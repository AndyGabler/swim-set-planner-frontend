# Swim Set Planner Frontend

## Description

This project is primarly to practice my skills with Angular and then demonstrate them.

That said, in addition to developing Angular as a hobby, I make it a goal to swim 4500-6000 yards a week. This is a site that helps me plan which sets will get me there.

## Docs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

In the future, running `ng e2e` will execute end-to-end tests via a platform of my choice. I'll need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
